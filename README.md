**Age Restrictions**  
If you have lists for younger members they will be restricted to rentals for their age level.

**How can I cancel subscriptions?**  
(throw event to stop billing)  
To cancel your membership with us, two things must happen:  

- You tell us that you want to cancel (so that we stop sending you any more rental discs)
- We receive back all rental discs that you have out on loan 

**Upgrade subscription**   
Any reduction in your bill resulting from a downgrade will take effect at the next billing period after any outstanding discs have been received to us. Any increase in your bill resulting from an upgrade will take effect immediately, being pro-rated to the remainder of your billing period, and the increase will be charged immediately (without changing any subsequent billing dates). Additional charges, resulting from an upgrade, are non-refundable.

**How can I down grade my subscriptions?**  
Only if you don¡¯t have more than your allotted number of discs out. And only after I invoice, i.e. can only change at the end of the month. Note: You can change your plan at any time during your billing month. You will be charged the new price from your next billing date, provided you have returned the correct number of Discs.
For example: if you are on the 3-Disc plan and want to downgrade to a 2-Disc plan, your account will not change until we have received 1 of the 3 Discs you currently possess.

**When downgrading my plan how is my monthly charge calculated?**  
(throw event to change billing)  
You can downgrade your plan at any time during your billing month. You will be charged the new plan price from your next billing date provided you have returned the relevant number of Discs.
If the relevant number of Discs have not been returned by your next billing date we will continue to charge you for the higher value plan. In this event we would recommend returning to the higher value plan to receive the best value for money. You should then downgrade your plan before your next billing date, allowing enough time to return your Discs.

**What happens if I go on holiday?**  
If you chose an unlimited package, you can take a payment holiday for up to three months.

You will only be able to take two account holidays per year. For example, if you take your first account holiday on 15-03-13 and your second account holiday on 15-06-13, your next account holiday will only be available again from 15-03-14.

You can take an account holiday at any time for a period of up to 90 days (and a minimum of 1 week). Simply use the drop down boxes on the Payment Holiday page to select the date you want your account holiday to start and how long you want it to last. 


**When taking a payment holiday how is my monthly payment worked out?**  
(throw event to pause billing)  
Your monthly payment will remain the same. At the end of your payment holiday we will delay your next billing date to take account of the value of the service that you have paid for and didn't use during your payment holiday. For example:
(Example based on a plan priced at ?14.99)
Your current billing date is on the 8th September. You will be billed ?14.99 for service between the 8th September and the 8th October.
On the 15th September you start a payment holiday that will end on the 20th September.
On the 20th September your payment holiday ends. Your new billing date will be 13th October (as there were 5 days service that you had paid for but not used). On 8th October you will not be charged. On 13th October you will be charged ?14.99.
If you wish to change your billing date from 13th October you can do so as soon as your payment holiday has ended.

**What happens after I have selected an end date for my payment holiday?**  
After you have selected the end date for your payment holiday you will receive a confirmation e-mail.
Make sure you allow time for the Discs to be returned as your payment holiday will not start until we have received them.
Note: While on your payment holiday you will not be sent any Discs but you will still be able to log in and amend your list or change any details necessary.

**Throttling / Fair Use**   
(Core Domain)  
One is the so-called "throttling" approach, which received a fair amount of publicity with regard to Netflix (which refers to the practice as a "fairness algorithm").[3] In this case, high-volume customers may experience a greater likelihood of (slower) shipments from alternative warehouses, when the nearest shipment centre does not have the requested movie. Also, if there is a high demand for a particular movie, it is more likely that an infrequent renter will get priority over the frequent renters, with the latter receiving a movie further down on their queue.
Netflix explains that what looks like throttling is the result of their fairness algorithm which gives priority to subscribers that don't exchange DVDs frequently.
